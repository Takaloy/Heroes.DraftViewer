# Heroes Draft Visualiser

StormReplay parser for the specific purpose of replaying drafts. This is a simple wrapper around Barrett's [heroes replay parser](https://github.com/barrett777/Heroes.ReplayParser). In order to keep the visualiser low maintenance and in sync, this repository uses git module, so it does require updating to repoint to the latest submodule.
